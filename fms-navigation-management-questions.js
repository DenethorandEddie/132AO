            explanation: "The four types of conditional waypoints are: passing through an altitude, flying a heading to a VOR radial or DME distance, intercepting a course, and heading vector to a course or fix. Each type changes location based on specific flight conditions.",

                "The location is calculated based on standard atmospheric conditions only"
            ],
            correct: 1,
            explanation: "Conditional waypoints' locations are not fixed and change with flight conditions. As wind, true airspeed, thrust available, and airplane pitch change, the location where the altitude constraint will be satisfied also changes.",
